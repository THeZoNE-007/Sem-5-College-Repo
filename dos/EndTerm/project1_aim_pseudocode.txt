- AIM:

-- The aim of the program is to simulate **First Come First Served (FCFS)** and **Round Robin (RR)** CPU scheduling 
algorithms, calculate performance metrics like **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, and **response time**, and 
display results through a **Gantt chart** and detailed process tables for better understanding of process execution.

- Program Purpose:

-- Simulates First Come First Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) CPU scheduling algorithms.
-- Calculates important metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and response time for each process.

- User Input:

-- The user enters the number of processes.
-- For each process, the user provides:
---- Process ID: Unique identifier for each process.
---- Arrival Time: Time when the process arrives in the system.
---- Burst Time: Time needed by the process to complete its execution.

- Scheduling Algorithms:

-- FCFS (First Come, First Served):
---- Processes are executed in the order of their arrival time.
---- The program calculates when each process finishes and computes the metrics based on this sequence.

-- Round Robin:
---- Each process gets a fixed time quantum (time slice) to execute.
---- If a process doesn't finish within its time quantum, itâ€™s placed back in the queue to be executed later.

- Metrics Calculated:

-- Turnaround Time (TAT): The total time from process arrival to completion (including waiting).
-- Waiting Time (WT): The time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before getting executed.
-- Response Time (RT): The time from process arrival to the first execution.

- Output Display:

-- Gantt Chart: Visually represents the order in which processes are executed.
-- Detailed Process Table: Shows the PID, arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, 
    waiting time, and response time for each process.
-- Average Times: Displays average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for all processes.

- Menu-driven Interface:

-- The program offers three options to the user:
---- Option 1: Execute FCFS scheduling.
---- Option 2: Execute Round Robin scheduling with a user-specified time quantum.
---- Option 3: Exit the program.

- Exit:

-- The program terminates when the user selects the exit option from the menu.

The program simulates CPU scheduling, helps visualize process execution, and calculates key performance metrics for each algorithm.
