-------< AIM >-------

### Program Aim:
- Simulate **FCFS** and **RR** CPU scheduling algorithms and calculate performance metrics.

----< PSEUDOCODE >----

### Purpose:
- Calculate **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, and **response time** for each process.

### User Input:
- Number of processes, followed by:
  - Process ID
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time

### Scheduling Algorithms:
1. **FCFS**: Executes processes in arrival order.
2. **Round Robin**: Allocates a fixed time quantum; requeues incomplete processes.

### Metrics Calculated:
- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: Total time from arrival to completion.
- **Waiting Time (WT)**: Time spent waiting in the queue.
- **Response Time (RT)**: Time from arrival to first execution.

### Output Display:
- Gantt Chart for execution order.
- Detailed Process Table with metrics.
- Average metrics for all processes.

### User Interface:
- Menu options to:
  - Execute FCFS scheduling.
  - Execute RR scheduling with specified quantum.
  - Exit the program.

### Exit:
- The program terminates upon selecting the exit option.
