I. Introduction

	A "Push", or unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0 provides a
    means for network adminstrators to easily install Windows NT 4.0 on
    similarly equipped systems.  The network administrator can create a
    bootable diskette that will automatically log into a central server
    and install the operating system from an image of the Windows NT 4.0
    installation directory stored on that server.
    This document provides instructions for a basic unattended installation
    of Windows NT 4.0 that includes the installation of drivers for the
    Intel(R) PRO/1000 adapter.  

    The elements necessary for the Windows NT 4.0 unattend installation are:

    -  A Windows NT 4.0 Server with a shared image of the \I386 directory
       from the Windows NT 4.0 installation CD.

    -  An unattended installation configuration file that provides Windows NT
       4.0 setup with information it needs to complete the installation.
       The name of this file is UNATTEND.TXT

    -  A DOS boot diskette that contains Microsoft Network Client software
       for connecting to the Windows NT 4.0 server and AutoExec commands
       to automatically start the Windows NT 4.0 installation. 


    This document will provide instructions for setting up the shared
    installation directory on the Windows NT 4.0 Server andd making changes 
    to the UNATTEND.TXT file.



II. Setting up an install directory on the file server

    1. Create a folder on the server's hard disk for the
       installation files (EX: "NT40.INS").  Make this folder
       shared (e.g., with shared name "NT40.INS").

    2. Create a user (EX: "USERID" with a password "password")
       and grant read and view rights for the NT40.INS folder.

    3. Use a CD-ROM drive at the Windows NT server and xcopy the i386
       folder with Windows NT 4.0 installation files to the shared
       folder NT40.INS on this server.  Use Windows NT Explorer or
       XCOPY /s to preserve the directory structure of the installation
       files.  When the copy is complete, the installation files should
       reside in the NT40.INS\I386 folder.

    4. Copy the sample UNATTEND.TXT file from the Drivers CD to the 
       NT40.INS\I386 folder.  
       Modify the installation answer file UNATTEND.TXT as
       required by your specific system and desired Windows NT
       configurations. Note that UNATTEND.TXT may be read-only and
       may need to be made write-able before editing (EX:
       attrib -r unattend.txt). A sample UNATTEND.TXT file with
       comments is included with this document.  The text of that file
       can also be in section IV of this document.  At a minimum
       you should update the items in the [UserData] section.


    5. Create the \E1000 folder in the installation share.  The full
       folder name is NT40.INS\i386\$OEM$\Net\E1000.

    6. Copy driver installation files:
       Copy the Driver installation files from the installation
       media to the to the proper place under Adapter Device Driver folder
       (NT40.INS\i386\$OEM$\Net\E1000 folder on the Windows NT
       server).  This enables the installation program to find
       the drivers during unattended installation.

       When complete the following files should be in the
       NT40.INS\i386\$OEM$\Net\E1000 directory.

           NMSAPI.DLL
           NMSCFG.SYS
           NMSDD.SYS
           NMSMsg.DLL
           NMSSvc.Exe
           NMSSvcPS.DLL
           REGSVR32.EXE
           INETWH32.DLL
           E1000NT4.SYS
           OEMSETUP.INF
           PROMON.EXE
           PROSETP.CPL
           PROSETP.CNT
           PROSETP.HLP
           PROSETP.REG
           ROBOEX32.DLL



III.  Performing the Unattended Installation

    2. Boot up your DOS network client diskette.

       After connecting to the network:

        a)  Input "USERID" as a User name when prompted.

        b)  Input "password" as a password when prompted.

                OR

        c)  Modify the NET START line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT to
            NET LOGON USERID PASSWORD /YES

       After the Windows NT 4.0 installation begins, Wait until the
       copy operation labelled "Setup is copying files..." in the
       line-draw characters box appears, then remove the diskette
       from the drive.  This will allow the unattended installation 
       to continue after the setup program reboots the system.
