Used a server and a client programme

Activated the server programme using the command "./server.out <port no you wanna receive msg from>

If you wanna track the traffic you can now turn on the Wireshark

Activated the client programme using the command "./client.out <target server's IP> <target server's port number>

Note: If you want to send msg to yourself, you can enter the loopback address in target server's IP

Now you are good to go
