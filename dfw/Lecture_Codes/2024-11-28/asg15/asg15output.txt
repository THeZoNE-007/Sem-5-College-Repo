TERMINAL COMMANDS EXECUTED:- (all being done in super user mode):-


timeout 100 netdiscover -r 172.17.155.186/16 | tee asg15.log
## The above command created a .log extension file that stores the output for the netdiscover command that was ran for 100 seconds within an IP range

## Note: We don't need the entire log file for filtering. We just need the last block since using the timeout command, the output was stored each time new packets were scanned that results in repetitions. For this we manually (file open then delete) keep the last block of output and delete the rest !! 


awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5}' asg15.log > filter_asg15_log.csv
## Using awk command, we filtered out only the necessary data from the log file and stored it in a new file with a .csv extension. 

## This still has some impurities that'll be taken care of using a Python program provided in question. The resulting file is our output !!


PYTHON CODE:-

import re

# Input and output file paths
input_file = "filter_asg15_log.csv"
output_file = "pre_process.csv"

# Regular expression to check if a line starts with a number
starts_with_number = re.compile(r'^\d')

# Open the input file for reading and the output file for writing
with open(input_file, "r") as infile, open(output_file, "w") as outfile:

  for line in infile:
    # Check if the line starts with a number
    if starts_with_number.match(line):
      outfile.write(line)

print(f"Filtered content saved to {output_file}")


OUTPUT:-

125447 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets,
