I. Introduction

	A "Push", or unattended installation of Windows XP provides a
    means for network adminstrators to easily install Windows XP on
    similarly equipped systems.  The network administrator can create a
    bootable diskette that will automatically log into a central server
    and install the operating system from an image of the Windows XP
    installation directory stored on that server.
    This document provides instructions for a basic unattended installation
    of Windows XP that includes the installation of drivers for the
    Intel(R) PRO/1000 Family of network adapters.  

    The elements necessary for the Windows XP unattend installation are:

    -  A Windows XP Server with a shared image of the Windows XP Installation
       CD.

    -  An unattended installation configuration file that provides Windows
       XP setup with information it needs to complete the installation.
       The name of this file is UNATTEND.TXT

    -  A DOS boot diskette that contains Microsoft Network Client software
       for connecting to the Windows XP server and AutoExec commands
       to automatically start the Windows XP installation.





II. Setting up an Install Directory on the File Server
	
    The server must be setup with a distribution folder that holds the required 
    Windows XP files and which clients can reach when connecting via TCP/IP or
    IPX.
    For illustration purposes, the examples in this readme use the network share 
    D:\PUSHXP.  To create this share, create a directory on the server, 
    (EX: D:\PUSHXP).  
	Next, use the "My Computer" applet in Windows XP to locate the D:\PUSHXP 
    folder. Right-click on the folder and select "Sharing".  Select "Share 
    this folder", Give it a share name (EX: PUSHXP).  This share name will be 
    used to connect to this directory from the remote target systems.  By 
    default, the permissions for this share will be for "Everyone" to have 
    "Full Control".   Adjust permissions as necessary and click OK.  

    To prepare the distribution folder:

       	1. Copy the entire contents of the Windows XP CD to D:\PUSHXP.
	       Use Windows Explorer or XCOPY in order to maintain the same 
           directory structure as on the CD.  When the copy is complete, the
           Windows XP installation files should be in the D:\PUSHXP
           directory and the I386 and other installation directories 
           should be subdirectories of the D:\PUSHXP directory.
 	
        2. Copy Unattend.txt from the Intel media (found in the same directory
           as these instructions) into the shared directory D:\PUSHXP\I386. 

        3. Edit the Unattend.txt file with Notepad or another text-editor
           to include your customizations.  At a minimum you should change
           the items in the [UserData] section of the file.

        4. Create the driver install directory structure and copy the driver 
           files to it.

           Make folders beneath the new PUSHXP\I386 as follows:

             \$OEM$\$$\Help
             \$OEM$\$$\System32
             \$OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\E1000
		
           Copy the driver files from the Drivers disk CD to the 
           $OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\E1000 directory.  Use XCOPY /S or Windows 
           Explorer to maintain the directory structure.  When finished the 
           $OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\E1000 directory should contain the NET8254x.INF
           file, the E1000NT5.SYS driver file and other files necessary for 
           installing the driver.



III. Deployment Methods
	
    1. Make sure that you have a copy of a network bootable MS-DOS floppy that 
       will connect to the Z:\PUSHXP directory and use it to boot the 
       destination system (the one you want to push install to) and connect 
       to this shared network directory.

    2. Run the command: (assumes prompt at \\Server\PUSHXP\i386):  
         winnt /u:Z:\I386\unattend.txt /s:Z:\I386 /t:c     
              (where Z: equals mapped drive)

    Important Note:
        In the above procedure, setup runs the installation in unattended 
        mode and also detects the plug and play network adapters.  All driver 
        files are copied from the shared directory to the target system 
        directories and installation of the OS and Network Adapters continues 
        without user intervention.


IV.  Microsoft documentation for unattended installations of Windows
     XP.

     For a complete description of the parameters supported in Unattend.txt
     see the DEPLOY.CHM document in the DEPLOY.CAB cabinet file on the 
     Windows XP CD.  To obtain the document, use Internet Explorer 5.0 or
     greater to open DEPLOY.CAB in the \SUPPORT\TOOLS directory on the CD.

     Other documents and utilities in the DEPLOY.CAB file provide details
     and tools for setting up a variety of unattended installation methods.
