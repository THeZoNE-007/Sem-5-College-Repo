I. Introduction

	A "Push", or unattended installation of Windows 2000 provides a
    means for network adminstrators to easily install Windows 2000 on
    similarly equipped systems.  The network administrator can create a
    bootable diskette that will automatically log into a central server
    and install the operating system from an image of the Windows 2000
    installation directory stored on that server.
    This document provides instructions for a basic unattended installation
    of Windows 2000 that includes the installation of drivers for the
    Intel(R) PRO/1000 family of network adapters.  

    The elements necessary for the Windows 2000 unattend installation are:

    -  A Windows 2000 Server with a shared image of the \I386 directory
       from the Windows 2000 installation CD.

    -  An unattended installation configuration file that provides Windows
       2000 setup with information it needs to complete the installation.
       The name of this file is UNATTEND.TXT

    -  A DOS boot diskette that contains Microsoft Network Client software
       for connecting to the Windows 2000 server and AutoExec commands
       to automatically start the Windows 2000 installation.





II. Setting up an Install Directory on the File Server
	
    The server must be setup with a distribution folder that holds the required 
    Windows 2000 files and which clients can reach when connecting via TCP/IP or
    IPX.
    For illustration purposes, the examples in this readme use the network share 
    D:\PUSH2K.  To create this share, create a directory on the server, 
    (EX: D:\PUSH2K) and create an I386 directory beneath it.  
	Next, use the "My Computer" applet in Windows 2000 to locate the D:\PUSH2K 
    folder. Right-click on the folder and select "Sharing".  Select "Share 
    this folder", Give it a share name (EX: PUSH2K).  This share name will be 
    used to connect to this directory from the remote target systems.  By 
    default, the permissions for this share will be for "Everyone" to have 
    "Full Control".   Adjust permissions as necessary and click OK.  

    To prepare the distribution folder:

       	1. Copy the \I386 folder from the Windows 2000 CD to D:\PUSH2K.
	       Use Windows Explorer or XCOPY in order to maintain the same 
           directory structure as on the CD.  When the copy is complete, the
           Windows 2000 installation files should be in the D:\PUSH2K\I386
           directory.
 	
        2. Copy Unattend.txt from the Intel media (found in the same directory
           as these instructions) into the shared directory D:\PUSH2K\I386. 

        3. Edit the Unattend.txt file with Notepad or another text-editor
           to include your customizations.  At a minimum you should change
           the items in the [UserData] section of the file.

        4. Create the driver install directory structure and copy the driver 
           files to it.

           Make folders beneath the new \i386 as follows:

             \$OEM$\$$\Help
             \$OEM$\$$\System32
             \$OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\E1000
		 
           Copy the driver files from the Drivers disk CD to the 
           $OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\E1000 directory.  Use XCOPY /S or Windows 
           Explorer to maintain the directory structure.  When finished the 
           $OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\E1000 directory should contain the NET8254x.INF
           file, the E1000NT5.SYS driver file and other files necessary for installing 
           the driver.


III. Deployment Methods
	
    1. Make sure that you have a copy of a network bootable MS-DOS floppy that 
       will connect to the Z:\PUSH2K directory and use it to boot the 
       destination system (the one you want to push install to) and connect 
       to this shared network directory.

    2. Run the command: (assumes prompt at \\Server\PUSH2K\i386):  
         winnt /u:Z:\I386\unattend.txt /s:Z:\I386 /t:c     
              (where Z: equals mapped drive)

    Important Note:
        In the above procedure, setup runs the installation in unattended 
        mode and also detects the plug and play network adapters.  All driver 
        files are copied from the shared directory to the target system 
        directories and installation of the OS and Network Adapters continues 
        without user intervention.


IV.  Microsoft documentation for unattended installations of Windows
     2000.

     For a complete description of the parameters supported in Unattend.txt
     see the UNATTEND.DOC document in the DEPLOY.CAB cabinet file on the 
     Windows 2000 CD.  To obtain the document, use Internet Explorer 5.0 or
     greater to open DEPLOY.CAB in the \SUPPORT\TOOLS directory on the CD.


     For deployment suggestions using a Windows 2000 RIS server and PXE boot see the 
     Boot Agent User's Guide.

     To configure and install the driver set on the RIS Server see the knowledge base 
     article Q246184 on Microsoft's support site at:
     http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q246/1/84.ASP?LN=EN-US&SD=gn&FR=0

     General information on how to preinstall an OEM driver set for Windows 2000 can be 
     found in knowledge base article Q254078
