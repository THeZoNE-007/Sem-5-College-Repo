I. A note about computer names in Microsoft networks

    There cannot be more than one computer with a particular name on the 
    network at any time, even during installation. Consequently to deploy 
    Windows 9x on multiple computers, you must manually change the value 
    of the computer name.

    Different configuration managers exist to overcome this hurdle in
    enterprise OS deployments.  For more information on deploying
    Windows 98 in an enterprise network, consult the Windows 98
    resource kit.

II. Setting up an install directory on the file server
	
Note: The network share Z:\PUSH is used here as an example path to the
      distribution folder.  The distribution folder is where the setup
      files for Windows 98 reside.  During the first step of the
      install, the client will connect to the distribution folder with
      IPX or TCP/IP.

    Before an unattended server based setup of Windows 98 can occur,
    a directory needs to be prepared.

    1.  Copy the contents of the Windows 98 setup folder from the Windows CD 
        to Z:\PUSH.  This is the folder on the CD that contains the 
        WIN98_xx.CAB files.  In retail Windows 98 this is in the \SETUP
        folder on the CD.  For Windows 98 SE this is the \SETUP\WIN98 folder
        on the CD.
        Use Explorer, Winfile or XCOPY in order to maintain the same 
        directory structure as on the CD.

    2.  Copy the PRO/1000 Family network drivers into the Z:\PUSH directory
        that now contains the .CAB files.  The following files from the 
        Driver media should be in the directory when done.


        E1000D.CAT
        NET8254D.INF
        NET8254D.DIN
        8255xDEL.EXE
        e1000W9x.sys
        

    3.  Copy the CUSTOM.INF and MSBATCH.INF files from the directory
        containing these instructions into the Z:\PUSH directory.

    4.  Review the copy of MSBATCH.INF within the Z:\PUSH directory.
        Make any changes needed to customize the install.

III. Deployment Methods

    There are many ways to perform an unattended installation or upgrade
    including but not limited to:

    - Setting up a login script that executes a setup statement when
      each user logs in

    - Inserting an object in an email message that runs setup when the 
      user clicks it

    - Using Microsoft SMS server to run Windows 9x Setup

    - Inserting a floppy that shares a drive on the network and runs
      setup from the shared drive

    - Copying the files to a local drive and then running an unattended
      setup from there

    - Use the Boot Strap Agent and an installed PXE Server. See the Boot Agent Users
      Guide for deployment suggestions and strategies for each OS.

    In the end each Network Administrator will find the easiest way
    to accomplish this goal for his or her own network.

    To avoid possible areas where an unattended installation might be 
    halted we recommend you use the following setup command line.

    Note: Do not include the argument "/ID" if there is any doubt that there is 
          sufficient free hard disk space.


       SETUP /IS /ID /IM /IE /IW
	  - "/IV" turns off billboards and speeds up the setup.
          - "/ID" turns off free diskspace check

IV. Where to get help

    The Windows Resource kits contains detailed information on unattended setups 
    and deploying Windows 98 in an enterprise environment.
